			<p>
				This policy applies to the Contraception IQ website, and app(s) for iOS and any other devices and platforms. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Your privacy &mdash; and your patients' privacy &mdash; is critically important to us. For questions regarding this privacy policy, please email <a href="mailto:contact@contraceptioniq.com">contact@contraceptioniq.com</a>. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Information Collected 
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Contraception IQ app (the "App") allows you to enter the conditions from a real or hypothetical patient's medical history, and receive recommendations on the suitability of various contraceptive methods. The App does not ask for any of your personal information. The conditions you select are not associated with any individual; the App does not ask for any identifying information about the real or hypothetical patient whose medical history you are describing. The App does not collect or attempt to determine who the selected conditions apply to, or even if there is a real patient at all. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The conditions you select and the recommendations you receive are only stored on the device where the App is running, either in memory or in temporary (non-permanent) storage. The conditions you select and the recommendations you receive are not saved or transmitted to any permanent storage, either on the device or anywhere else. The App does not share or transmit any protected health information (PHI). 
			</p>
			<p>
				The App may store and transmit some anonymous information about usage of the app. For example, the App may log general information about your device, such as screen size. The App may also collect anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the application. Additionally, the App collects and stores crash logs to help improve the application. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Contraception IQ website is a static site hosted on Github Pages. Please see the Github Pages Privacy Policy: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/</a>

			<h2>
				Information Usage 
			</h2>
			<p>
				Contraception IQ uses the information collected to operate and improve the App and the Contraception IQ website, and for customer support. Contraception IQ may share anonymous, aggregated statistics with outside parties, such as the number of users of the app, or the number of subscriptions purchased. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Contraception IQ may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Contraception IQ believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Contraception IQ, third parties or the public at large. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Business Transfers 
			</h2>
			<p>
				If Contraception IQ, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information may be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Contraception IQ may continue to use the collected information as set forth in this policy. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Privacy Policy Changes 
			</h2>

				Although most changes are likely to be minor, Contraception IQ may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Contraception IQ's sole discretion. Contraception IQ encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
